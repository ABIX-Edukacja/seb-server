/** SEB-Server (Safe Exam Browser Server) is a server component to maintain and support
 * Exams running with SEB (Safe Exam Browser). TODO add link(s)
 * 
 * SEB-Server uses Spring Boot as main framework is divided into two main components,
 * a webservice component that implements the business logic, persistence management
 * and defines a REST API to expose the services over HTTP. The second component is a
 * GUI component built on RAP RWT/SWT that also uses Spring components to connect and use
 * the webservice over HTTP. The two components are (implementation-wise) completely separated
 * from each other by the Rest API and the webservice can also be used by another client.
 * SEB-Server uses Spring's profiles to consequently separate sub-components of the webservice
 * and GUI and can be used to start the components on separate servers or within the same
 * server instance. Additional to the usual profiles like dev, prod, test there are combining
 * profiles like dev-ws, dev-gui and prod-ws, prod-gui
 * 
 * TODO documentation for presets to start all-in-one server or separated gui- and webservice- server */
