/** A privilege consisting of a overall grant type, a institutional grant type and a owner grant type.
 *
 * The overallGrantType defines the grant type independent of an institutional relation as well as an owner
 * relation. The institutionalGrantType defines the grant type specific to the institutional relation of an entity.
 * And the ownerGrantType defines the grant type specific to the ownership of an entity
 *
 * For example with a privilege of:
 * overallGrantType = READ_ONLY
 * institutionalGrantType = MODIFY
 * ownerGrantType = WRITE
 *
 * A user with such a privilege is granted to see all type of specified entities independent of institutional relation
 * or ownership, is able to modify all type of specified entities within its own institution and is able to create or
 * delete owned entities. */
